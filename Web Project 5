Declare variable for romannum
Input number between 1-10 for num
If num is 
Solution
unction romanize (num) {
	if (!+num)
		return false;
	var	digits = String(+num).split(""),
		key = ["","I","II","III","IV","V","VI","VII","VIII","IX"],
		roman = "",
		i = 3;
	while (i--)
		roman = (key[+digits.pop() + (i * 10)] || "") + roman;
	return Array(+digits.join("") + 1).join("M") + roman;
}
